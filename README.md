## Ukelele Voice Recognition

This application uses [this React Ukelele Module](https://github.com/newpatriks/ukelele-react-module). It also uses [this for the Web Speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API).


The goal of this example is to learn about the speech recognition html API and build something very simple with it. So feel free to give any feedback you might consider.

### How to run it
- Run `npm install`
- Install general dependencies such as React, ReactDOM, Webpack, Babel, etc.
- You can use either `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack` to run it.
- When the page is loaded, you need to say the name of the chords to see the chords on your screen. Chords available by now are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
